# Streamlit Practices Project: MyCalculator

Welcome to the **Streamlit Practices Project: MyCalculator**. This project aims to implement fundamental software engineering practices using Git, GitHub, and the Streamlit framework. By creating a basic calculator application, contributors will gain hands-on experience with application deployment, code reviews, and writing well-documented code. The project emphasizes the principles of modularization, Single Responsibility (SOLID), and designing for low coupling and high cohesion.

## Objectives

1. **Git and GitHub in Production**: Enhance practical knowledge and application of Git and GitHub in a production environment.
2. **Application Deployment**: Learn the fundamentals of deploying applications, with a focus on using the Streamlit framework.
3. **Software Engineer Adaptation**: Adapt to the practices, tools, and workflows commonly used in software engineering.
4. **PR and Code Review**: Understand and engage in Pull Requests (PR) and code review processes to ensure code quality and collaboration.
5. **Design Principles**: Implement design principles such as modularization, Single Responsibility (SOLID), low coupling, and high cohesion.
6. **Documentation**: Write comprehensive and clear documentation for applications to ensure readability and maintainability.

## Task Description

Develop a Streamlit-based web application that functions as a basic calculator. This calculator should enable users to perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.

## Development Requirements

1. **Repository Forking**: Fork this repository to begin development. Ensure all development work is carried out on the forked repository.
2. **Calculator Features**: Implement the following arithmetic operations:
   - **Addition**: Adding two numbers.
   - **Subtraction**: Subtracting two numbers.
   - **Division**: Dividing two numbers.
   - **Multiplication**: Multiplying two numbers.
3. **User Interface**: The application should include titles and be aesthetically pleasing with necessary cosmetics.
4. **Repository Structure**: Maintain the following file structure, with the flexibility to add more files as needed:
   ```
   .app/
      |-- main_ui.py       # Main Streamlit user interface
      |-- calculator.py    # Arithmetic operations
      |-- utils.py         # Utility functions
      |-- requirements.txt # Project dependencies
      |-- .gitignore       # Files to ignore in Git
   ```
5. **Code Quality**:
   - Ensure each function or method is concise and fits within a "palm-size" limit.
   - Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to all functions.
   - Include docstrings and necessary comments for clarity and documentation purposes.
6. **User-Friendly Design**: The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate for users.

## Contributing

1. Develop features and make improvements on your forked version of the repository.
2. Write clear, concise, and well-documented code following the outlined requirements.
3. Create Pull Requests (PR) against the original repository for review.
4. Engage in the code review process to discuss potential improvements or necessary changes.
